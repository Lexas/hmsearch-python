hmsearch-python
===============

This repository held an earlier attempt at implementing HmSearch with
Python and MongoDB.  It mainly served to learn the algorithm, and have
now been reimplemented as a C++ library:
https://github.com/commonsmachinery/hmsearch

When we get time, this repository will instead be used to host a
Python package providing an interface to this C++ library.
